 * \brief Provides named CUDA timer functionality.

 * \section Example
 * The following example creates two timers, and times two functions.  After
 * timing the first function, the time for the first timer is reported.  After
 * the second timer is run, all timer results are reported.

 * myTimer.stop("demo timer 2");
